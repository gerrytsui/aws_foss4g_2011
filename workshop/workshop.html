        <h2>Availability Zones</h2>
      </hgroup>
        <p>An Availability Zone is a set of locations within an AWS Region. Each
    zone is independent from other zones to protect from failure.</p>
        <p>The Region name is part of the zone name, eg:</p>
        <pre>us-east-1d</pre>
        <p>This is one of the four zones in the us-east-1 Region</p>
        <p>The mapping of a zone name to a location is different and consistent
    for each AWS account. This means that we maybe both be in zone us-east-1d
    but they maybe in different locations.</p>

        <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
        <h2>Region</h2>
      </hgroup>
        <p>A Region is a set of Availability Zones in a geographic area. The AWS
    Region name generally indicates the area that is covered. The curent regions
    are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>eu-west-1	ec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com is in Ireland</li>
          <li>us-east-1	ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com is in Virginia</li>
          <li>ap-northeast-1	ec2.ap-northeast-1.amazonaws.com is in Japan</li>
          <li>us-west-1	ec2.us-west-1.amazonaws.com is in California</li>
          <li>ap-southeast-1	ec2.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com Singapore</li>
       </ul>

       <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
       <h2>Access Identifiers</h2>
     </hgroup>
     <p>Access identifiers are used to identify accounts and create a
    signature for each request made.</p>
     <p> Indentifiers use public key encryption which come in pairs. The first
    part is public and identifies a single AWS account. The second part is
    private and used to create a signature for each request.</p>
     <p>AWS provide two different sets of acces identifiers. The first is an
    Access Key ID and a Secret Access Key. The second set is a X.509 certificate
    with public and private keys.</p>
     <p>In practice you will need your public key and the X.509 certificate to
    perform most AWS tasks.</p>

       <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
       <h2>Amazon Machine Image (AMI)</h2>
     </hgroup>
     <p>Amazon Machine Image is a virtual instance of a server. It contains the
    operating system and software that comprise you application(s).</p>
     <p>You can use a pre-built AMI, customize it, and create a new AMI based on
    your changes</p>
     <p>Each AMI has a unique id, eg: <code>ami-63be790a</code></p>
     <p>The AWS AMU catalog contains a complete list of public and registered AMIs.</p>

     <hgroup>
       <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
       <h2>Instance</h2>
     </hgroup>
     <p>An instance is a running copy of an AMI. You can launch multiple
    instances of the same AMI. They can be managed through the command-line or
    using the AWS Management Console through a web browser.</p>
     <p>More info on instance types on <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#instance">Amazon</a></p>

     <hgroup>
       <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
       <h2>Elastic IP Address</h2>
     </hgroup>
     <p>AWS allocates fixed static addresses to each instance. They are Elastic
    because you can allocate, attach, detach and free addresses as needed</p>
     <p>There is a limit of 5 Elastic IP Addresses per user</p>
     <p>More info at <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1346">AWS Feature Guide</a></p>

       <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
       <h2>Security Group</h2>
     </hgroup>
     <p>A security group is the allowable set of inbound network connection for
    an instance. Each group has a unique name and lists the protocols, ports,
    and IP address ranges that are allowed.</p>
     <p>A single group can be applied to multiple instances and multiple groups
    can be applied to single instance.</p>
     <p>Security groups typically permit access to ports 22 and 80 for access to
    ssh and a webserver. Additional ports can be added to the security group
    such as port 8080 for apache-tomcat or 5432 for postgres. In addition to
    adding these ports to a security group, the application will also have to be
    configured to accept external requests as needed.</p>
     <p>More information in security groups are on <a
    href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/">Amazon</a></p>

       <h1>Key Concepts</h1>
       <h2>Access Control List</h2>
     </hgroup>
     <p>An Access Control List (ACL) specifies permissions for buckets and
    objects. Every bucket and object has an ACL that defines which AWS accounts
    and groups that can access the object.</p>
     <p>ACLs can be manage through the AWS Management Console or through a third
    party application such as S3Fox</p>

        <h2>Simple Storage Service</h2>
      </hgroup>
      <p>S3 is used to store binary data objects for private or public use. It
    is fault tolerant, assumes that hardware failire is common, and makes
    multiple copies to achieve high availability and durability.</p>
      <p>All objects reside in buckets and any single object has a 5gb
    limit. You can have as many objects in a single bucket as needed</p>
      <p>An S3 account can have 100 buckets.</p>
      <p>You must have a globally unique bucket name and a key unique to that
    bucket. For example:
        <code>http://my_awesome_mapserver.s3.amazonaws.com/hurricane_irene.tiff</code>
      </p>
      <p> S3 is the place to store static files such as static pages,
    javascript, imagery, and other media files.</p>
      <p>S3 charges are based on amount of data stored, amount of data
    transfered in and out, and the number of requests made</p>

        <h2>Elastic Block Store (EBS)</h2>
      </hgroup>
      <p>An Elastic Block Store is a disk volume. You can attach it to any
    running instance in the same Availability Zone.</p>
      <p>Volumes are independent of any instance, that means they persist when
    an instance is shutdown or terminated</p>
      <p>EVS volumes are useful for storing application data such as database tables.</p>

        <h2>Elastic Compute Cloud - Standard</h2>
      </hgroup>
      <p>EC2 is the infrastructure underlaying the ability to lauch Amazon
    Machine Instances</p>
      <p>There are instances to meet the majority of needs through providing a
    range of memory, processing power and local disk storage</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Standard Instances have memory to CPU ratios suitable for most
    general purpose applications;
          <ul>
            <li>High-Memory instances offer larger memory sizes for high
    throughput applications, including database and memory caching
    applications</li>
            <li>High-CPU instances have proportionally more CPU
    resources than memory (RAM) and are well suited for compute-intensive
    applications.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
   <section>
      <hgroup>
        <h1>Building Blocks</h1>
        <h2>Elastic Compute Cloud - Micro</h2>
      </hgroup>
      <ul>
        <li>Micro instances provide a small amount of consistent CPU resources
    and allow you to burst CPU capacity when additional cycles are
    available. They are well suited for lower throughput applications and web
    sites that consume significant compute cycles periodically.
        <li>At steady state,
    Micro instances receive a fraction of the compute resources that Small
    instances do. Therefore, if your application has compute-intensive or steady
    state needs, a Small instance (or larger, depending on your needs) is
    recommended.</li>
        <li>However, Micro instances can periodically burst up to 2 ECUs
    (for short periods of time). This is double the number of ECUs available
    from a Standard Small instance. Therefore, if you have a relatively low
    throughput application or web site with an occasional need to consume
    significant compute cycles using Micro instances is recommended.</li>
      </ul>

        <h2>Elastic Compute Cloud - Other</h2>
      </hgroup>
      <ul>
        <li>Cluster Compute instances provide a very large amount of CPU
    coupled with increased network performance making them well suited for High
    Performance Compute (HPC) applications and other demanding network-bound
    applications.</li>
        <li>Cluster GPU instances provide general-purpose graphics processing
    units (GPUs) with proportionally high CPU and increased network performance
    making them well suited for applications benefitting from highly
    parallelized processing, including HPC, rendering and media processing
    applications.</li>
      </ul>
   </section>
   <section>
     <hgroup>
       <h1>Building Blocks</h1>
       <h2>Elastic Load Balancer</h2>
     </hgroup>
     <p>The Elastic Load Balancer distributes traffic across EC2 instances.</p>
     <p>Instances can be in the same Availability Zone or scattered across
    several zones in a Region</p>
     <p>The Load Balancer checks the health of instances it manages and stops
    sending traffic to unhealthy or non-responsive instances</p>
     <p>The Load Balancer works well with stateless applications, such as OGC
    Web Services or RESTful APIs</p>
  </section>
   <section>
     <hgroup>
       <h1>Building Blocks</h1>
       <h2>Cloud Watch and Auto Scaling</h2>
     </hgroup>
     <p>CloudWatch is a feature that provides monitoring within EC2 by
    collecting and storing performance information such as
       <ul>
         <li>CPU load average</li>
         <li>disk I/O rate</li>
         <li>network I/O rate</li>
       </ul>
     </p>
     <p>Auto Scaling uses the data collected by CloudWatch to add instances as
    demand increases and terminate them as demand decreases within an
    auto scaling group</p>
     <p>You can set triggers for adding or decreasing the number of instances by
    using Auto Scaling</p>
